# Cold Music

Author: Hao Chen

Design: Pick up radios playing music in the endless blizzard where you got lost. The night is coming, maybe only music can lead you home.

How To Play:

- A FPS style camera is implemented which you may be familiar with. Mouse controls view and WASD controls move.
- Find the radios nearby. At first you can see them, but when the blizzard becomes harsher and the sky gets darker, the music may be the only way you can find them.
